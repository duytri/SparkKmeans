My mother accompanied me to school on the first day. 
Other parents accompanied their children as well. 
We all waited in front of the school office.
Soon a teacher came and led us to some classrooms. 
There we were put into four separate classes. 
This was when some children began to cry as the parents were not allowed into the classrooms. 
I did not cry because I had been to kindergarten before. 
Actually my mother went home soon after for she knew I would be all right.
It was an enjoyable time for me as I got to know my new classmates. 
The teacher was very busy writing down our particulars so we had plenty of time to ourselves.
Meantime some children continued to sob while their parents looked in anxiously through the windows.
Soon recess came. 
Some of us headed for the tuck-shop while the rest headed for their parents. 
I bought a drink with the money my mother gave me. 
Getting to know my new friends had made me thirsty.
After recess we went back to out classroom and my new friends and I managed to coax two boys to stop crying. 
In fact, soon we were laughing and playing together. 
Once in a while the teacher had to tell us to keep quiet as we were making too much noise.
Still some parents looked in anxiously through the windows.
Finally the bell rang for us to go home. 
Some of us were very relieved to be reunited with our parents. 
I too was glad to see my mother waiting for me at the school gate. 
I had made many friends. It had been a wonderful first day at school.
